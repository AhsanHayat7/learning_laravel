Setting Up Frontend Structure in Laravel with PHP

Folder Structure:

1. Create a frontend folder in resources/views/.
2. Move index.blade.php and other blade files to the frontend folder.
3. Create a frontend folder in the public directory.
4. Move assets (CSS, JS, images) to the frontend folder within public.

Layouts:

1. Create a layouts folder within the frontend directory.
2. Create app.blade.php, scripts.blade.php, style.blade.php, header.blade.php, footer.blade.php, and main.blade.php.
3. Copy relevant code sections from index.blade.php into corresponding layout files.
4. In main.blade.php, include the header and footer, and yield the main container.

Controllers:

1. Create controllers corresponding to website pages (e.g., home, about, contact, services, portfolio).
2. Define functions in controllers corresponding to routes in web.php.
3. In controller functions, return views located in resources/views/frontend folder.

Routes:

1. Include controllers in web.php (e.g., App\Http\Controllers\Frontend\HomeController).
2. Define GET routes with controllers to view web pages.
3. Use URLs defined in web.php in header, index.blade.php, and other blade files.
4. Define URLs and folder directories for assets in footer, style, scripts, and other blade files.

index.blade.php:

1. Extract header, footer, scripts, and styles code to layout files.
2. Remove header, footer, scripts, and styles code from index.blade.php.
3. Utilize the main container to include header and footer across pages using @extends('frontend.layouts.app) and @section('main-container).

Blade Files:

1. Use blade files provided by the website or create new ones based on index.blade.php.
2. Create blade files such as about.blade.php, contact.blade.php, etc.

Final Steps:

1. Refer to index.blade.php for code selection and removal based on commented lines.
2. Run php artisan serve command for local server deployment.
