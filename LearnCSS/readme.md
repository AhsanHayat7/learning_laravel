## Cascading Style Sheets

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the style of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, or in other media.

### Key Points

- **Separation of Content and Style**: CSS allows you to separate the content of a document from its presentation. This makes it easier to maintain and update the look and feel of a website without altering its content.
- **Selectors and Properties**: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them using properties and values.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS enables the creation of responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Flexibility and Control**: With CSS, you have control over the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of a webpage.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of CSS in action:

#### HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph styled with CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
