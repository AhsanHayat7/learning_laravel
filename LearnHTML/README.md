# Web Development Components

## HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
HTML is the code used to structure a webpage and its content. It consists of various tags that define different elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML provides the foundation for designing the structure of websites.
Attributes are used to add more information to the tag.
A container for some content or other HTML tags.
<p> This is a paragraph </p> =>element
        content

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used for styling and presentation on webpages. It allows developers to control the layout, appearance, and design of HTML elements. With CSS, you can define styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, borders, and positioning, making your webpage visually appealing and user-friendly.

## JavaScript (JS)
JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages. It enables developers to create interactive features such as animations, form validations, dynamic content updates, and more. JavaScript is responsible for the logic and functionality of a webpage, making it responsive and engaging for users.

## Example
To illustrate the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development, let's consider the analogy of building a house:

- **HTML**: HTML is like the blueprint of the house. It defines the structure and layout, specifying how many rooms to build and where to place them. HTML tags act as the building blocks for constructing the webpage's structure.

- **CSS**: CSS is similar to interior design and decoration. It determines the style and appearance of the house, including the colors of the walls, the shape and size of furniture, and other visual elements. CSS stylesheets apply visual enhancements to HTML elements, making the webpage visually appealing.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript serves as the electrical wiring and automation system of the house. It adds functionality and interactivity to the webpage, enabling features like clicking a button to turn on a fan or submitting a form to process data. JavaScript handles the dynamic behavior and logic of the webpage, making it responsive to user interactions.

In summary, HTML defines the structure, CSS styles the presentation, and JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity, collectively creating a fully functional and visually pleasing website.
