```The `window` object represents an open window in a browser. It is browser's object (not Javascript's) and is automatically created by the browser. It is a global object with lots of properties and methods.```

## What is the DOM:
```When a webpage is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.```

```HTML->JS->turns into object->document this document is avaliable on the window document```


```Window.documet```
```console.dir(window.document)```
```We can access the html in the javascript in window object in document```

```Window->document->html->head->body->div->script```


```DOM is used for Dynamic changes in our web page```
